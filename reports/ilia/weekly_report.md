## Reports

### Week [KW 46]

- **Update 1**: We have started working on our project, held several initial meetings, and assigned tasks
- **Update 2**: I have read the recommended research papers for the project (there were three of them) and tried to understand them as much as possible
- **Update 3**: We divided the tasks, and I was assigned the Task Unification task
- **Next Steps**: to think about how we will implement our task and its structure.

### Week [KW 47]

- **Update 1**: We divided the work on our task as follows: each team member is assigned a specific model, and I took on the task of integrating SAM-v2 into our project.
- **Update 2**: At home, I thought about how we could implement our project and presented my vision during the weekly meeting

- **Update 3**: We discussed my vision and made adjustments after reaching a consensus. We decided to split the task into two stages: first, we will create a pipeline as a Python module for professional developers so they can work with it as developers. Once that is implemented, we will integrate it into a user-friendly interface for end-users without programming knowledge.
- **Next Steps**: To start the implementation of the pipeline

### Week [KW 48]

- **Update 1**: I started studying the SAM-v2 model in more detail: reviewing the code, testing its functionality, analyzing the parameters, inputs, and outputs of the functions, exploring and applying the usage instructions, as well as working with demonstration examples in Google Colab
- **Update 2**: I started implementing the pipeline, focusing on my assigned model. Later, we plan to integrate the other models that my teammates are working on in parallel
- **Next Steps**: to finish our pipline 

### Week [KW 49]

- **Update 1**: I wrote the first version of the handler for our model, which provided a user-friendly interface for easy interaction with our model. It allowed users to simply select a point on the image, click on it, and get the 3 best masks with scores. To achieve this, I extracted the handler functions from the original model into a separate file and also wrote my own functions
- **Update 2**: I started to prepare to our mid-term presentation
- **Next Steps**: Fix my model so that it includes more advanced features, such as excluding a certain area from segmentation or working with video (since SAM-2 is capable of this), and also work on our presentation and present it

### Week [KW 50]

- **Update 1**: Next week, we dedicated our time to preparing for the presentation and gave it.
- **Update 2**: I also prepared a video for my team to explain my part of the work and to present the concept of what I would be talking about during the presentation (it was just a video; in the end, we didn't include it in the presentation, and I presented it myself)
- 
- **Next Steps**: Discuss our presentation at the last meeting of the year
