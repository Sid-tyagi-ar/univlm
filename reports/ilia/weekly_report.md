## Reports

### Week [KW 46]

- **Update 1**: We have started working on our project, held several initial meetings, and assigned tasks
- **Update 2**: I have read the recommended research papers for the project (there were three of them) and tried to understand them as much as possible
- **Update 3**: We divided the tasks, and I was assigned the Task Unification task
- **Next Steps**: to think about how we will implement our task and its structure.

### Week [KW 47]

- **Update 1**: We divided the work on our task as follows: each team member is assigned a specific model, and I took on the task of integrating SAM-v2 into our project.
- **Update 2**: At home, I thought about how we could implement our project and presented my vision during the weekly meeting

- **Update 3**: We discussed my vision and made adjustments after reaching a consensus. We decided to split the task into two stages: first, we will create a pipeline as a Python module for professional developers so they can work with it as developers. Once that is implemented, we will integrate it into a user-friendly interface for end-users without programming knowledge.
- **Next Steps**: To start the implementation of the pipeline

### Week [KW 48]

- **Update 1**: I started studying the SAM-v2 model in more detail: reviewing the code, testing its functionality, analyzing the parameters, inputs, and outputs of the functions, exploring and applying the usage instructions, as well as working with demonstration examples in Google Colab
- **Update 2**: I started implementing the pipeline, focusing on my assigned model. Later, we plan to integrate the other models that my teammates are working on in parallel
- **Update 3**: 
- **Next Steps**: to finish out pipline 

### Week [KW 49]
